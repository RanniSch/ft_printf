# ft_printf
The goal of this project is to recode printf() with a variable number of arguments.<br> <br>
For example, the function can handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX% <br> <br>
For each conversion required by the subject, there's a function that converts the argument and returns the numer of bytes writed: <br>
• %c print a single character.
• %s print a string of characters.
• %p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
• %d print a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i print an integer in base 10.
• %u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16).
• %% print a percent sign.
